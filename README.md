> This is the completed visualization of our Microsft Sentinel Log analysis map after 24 hours of monitoring our system. As you can see this visualization presents various locations around the world where our attackers geoIp were found based on our log analytics. Using our PowerShell script we comprised we were able to automate a task in (KQL) Kusto Query Language allowing us to filter out our log analytics to key in on specifications like; time generated, computer, attackerIp, Ipaddres, city name, country name, latitude, and longitude.
